# BeerSpectrophotometry
The app produces the SRM (Standard Reference Method) number, which indicates beer quality for a specific type of beer.  A picture is taken of the sample, that has a controlled light is passed through it.  The rgb values of the pixels of the image are averaged.  The blue value is extracted converted into an absorbance value, and the absorbance(A) value into the SRM value (SRM has a standard equation 12.7*D*A).  The app is developed to be used in an enclosure that imitates a spectrophotometer and the enclosure's main purpose is to block out excess/environmental light from being captured by the camera, but may be modified to work without the enclosure.
